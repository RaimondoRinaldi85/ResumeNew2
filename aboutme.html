				<h2>About Me</h2>
			</header>
			<div>
				<article class="about">
					<p>Shortly after I started college, I had to put my education on hold
						and
						return
						home to work and help my family. My first job was as an electrician’s assistant for an
						independent company that worked with generator motors and building implants. I assisted
						with
						soldering and assembling electrical implants. <br><br>

						My next job was working for a service group as a freelance waiter and bartender. It was
						during
						this time that I trained and acquired my strong social skills, while gaining valuable
						experience
						communicating in English, French, Spanish, German as well as my native language of
						Italian.<br><br>

						While working as a bartender and a waiter I was also working as a chemistry lab
						technician
						for
						Legambiente. Legambiente is a company that promotes and enhances a wide variety of
						production
						actions with the goal of improving the quality of the environment. My responsibilities
						as a
						chemistry lab technician were to analyze water and food to find any trace of harmful
						substances.
						All that I had learned with my Chemistry Technician Diploma was put into action during
						my
						time
						at Legambiente.<br><br>

						In 2014 I started working for M3XP, which is a hardware laboratory in Sarno, Italy. I
						managed to
						accrue three years of work experience in the IT field working for this hardware and
						software
						company. I had the privilege of working for SawSystems in their Hardware Laboratory as
						its
						chief, where I learned valuable professional skills such as soldering, installing and
						troubleshooting hardware and software for clients. In the meantime, I was also a
						freelance
						bilingual technician for companies and businesses and I was a private IT.<br><br>

						In 2017 I attended three conventions for a SawSystems’ Start-up in Bologna, Berlin, and
						Milan
						where I spoke in Italian and English with potential financial lenders for the company’s
						team. I
						also had the job of translating the app and the app’s brochure from Italian to English
						for
						the
						Berlin convention. Through the years I have been a translator for businesses,
						acquaintances,
						and
						friends translating simultaneously between spoken and written Italian and
						English.<br><br>

						Working as a bilingual IT for the past five years has developed my troubleshooting
						skills by
						working with a variety of hardware and software for my clients. I have gained experience
						with
						installation and the use of software for accountants, lawyers, and factories. I have
						developed
						my knowledge of setting up, organizing, installing, and troubleshooting servers mounting
						Microsoft software, Mac, and Linux Server distros operating systems. I have much
						experience
						setting up, organizing, and installing LAN connections, routers/modems as well as
						troubleshooting connections problems. As an IT, I have the opportunity to travel to
						clients’
						place of business to make repairs, or assist clients remotely in addition to providing
						tips
						and
						helping customers when they need to buy new hardware. I have created several websites
						for
						clients using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SASS. I also have experience with BootStrap 4,
						VueJS,
						and React frameworks.<br><br>

						In my professional and personal life, I have been consistently praised as being
						result-oriented
						by my clients and peers. Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or professional
						projects,
						I apply proven communication, language, and multitasking skills, which I will leverage
						into
						the
						role at your company.<br><br>

						After reviewing my resume, I hope you will agree that I am the type of competent and
						competitive
						candidate you are looking for. I look forward to elaborating on how my specific skills
						and
						abilities will benefit your organization. Please contact me via email at
						<a href="mailto:raimondorinaldi85@gmail.com">raimondorinaldi85@gmail.com</a> to set up an
						interview.
